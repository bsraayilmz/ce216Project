PREFACE 

THE aim in compiling this book has been to make the 
list of words in common use concise yet full, and 
authoritative yet suggestive. Above five thousand leading 
words are given, and the synonyms and antonyms comprise 
several thousand more different words. 

Actual references may be multiplied by looking up a 
synonym or antonym, as well as by consulting cognate 
words, such as the corresponding noun, verb, or adjective. 

In some cases common words have been omitted, because 
they were composed of a root word and a prefix, intensive 
or privative. Their synonyms and antonyms may be found 
under the root word. 

Occasionally within the lists words closely synonymous 
or antonymic have been grouped within semicolons. 

The part of speech of a word is designated by an abbrevi- 
ation in such cases as are necessary to save confusion. 

Synonyms appear immediately after the leading word ; an- 
tonyms, after the abbreviation "Ant." This order is 
invariable. 

In the effort to make this list authoritative, the standard 
dictionaries and the acknowledged authorities on the sub- 
ject have been consulted.
